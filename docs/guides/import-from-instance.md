# Importing from Invidious or Piped

If you have an Invidious or Piped account with existing subscriptions, you can import them into Yattee.

## Import Subscriptions

1. Go to **Settings > Sources** and tap the Invidious or Piped instance you want to import from.
2. In the **Account** section, tap **Log in** and enter your credentials.
3. Once logged in, an **Import** section appears. Tap **Import Subscriptions**.
4. Yattee fetches your subscriptions from the instance and displays them as a list. Each channel shows its name, avatar, and subscriber count.
5. Tap the **+** button next to a channel to add it, or tap **Add All** in the toolbar to import everything at once.

## Import Playlists

From the same **Import** section, tap **Import Playlists** to bring over your playlists. The flow works the same way — browse the list and add individually or all at once.
