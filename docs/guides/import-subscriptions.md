2. Click **Deselect all** to clear the default selection.
3. Scroll down and check **YouTube and YouTube Music**.
4. Click **All YouTube data included**, then ensure **Subscriptions** is checked.
5. Click **OK**, then **Next step**.

7. Wait for the export to complete -- Google will email you a download link.

## Step 2: Import into Yattee

1. Download and extract the archive from Google.
2. Find the `subscriptions.csv` file inside the archive.
3. Open Yattee and go to **Channels** or **Subscriptions**.
4. Tap the **View Options** icon, then tap **Subscriptions Data**.
